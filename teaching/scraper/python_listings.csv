Python Basics,180,Learn the building blocks of the wonderful general purpose programming language Python.,"['Meet Python', 'Types and Branching', 'Functions and Looping', 'All Together Now']"
Introducing Lists,107,Lists are a powerful data type that allow you to store multiple ordered values in a single container. You are gonna love them.,"['Meet Lists', 'Using Lists', 'Build an Application']"
Introducing Tuples,13,"Learn about a python data structures that's similar to lists, but with one key difference!",['Getting to Know Tuples']
"Functions, Packing,  and Unpacking",65,"Learn the ins and outs of Python functions, how to send and receive values to functions, and all about Python packing and unpacking.","['Introduction to Functions', 'Getting Info In and Out of Functions', 'Packing and Unpacking']"
Python Sequences,65,"Discover several types of Python sequences, many ways of sequence iterations, and all of the common sequence operations.","['Sequence Iteration', 'Sequence Operations']"
Introducing Dictionaries,36,Another useful Python data structure is the dictionary. Learn how to write one and use one in your day to day Python code.,"['Introducing Dictionaries', 'Iterating and Packing with Dictionaries']"
Understanding Dunder Main (__main__),5,"In Python there are naming conventions for some special methods that utilize the double underscore character along with the method name. In this workshop weâ€™ll talk about using a recommended Python best practice, dunder main.","['Unit Testing', 'Writing Unit Tests', 'Test Driven Development', 'What To Test']"
Object-Oriented Python,180,"Sometimes simple scripts with functions in them just aren't enough. Eventually you'll need logical models of your work and that'll lead you to creating custom classes in Python.
Object-oriented programming is a large topic. It provides us some amazing tools, though, so it's one of the most beneficial things to learn about in Python.
First, you'll learn how to build basic custom classes. Then, you'll expand them through inheritance. And for some extra power, you'll also learn how to take control of Python's built-in classes to make your own more powerful while doing less work. Finally, we'll put everything together into a fun game utility.","['Instant Objects', 'Inheritance', 'Advanced Objects', 'Dice Roller']"
Write Better Python,70,"We've learned the ins and outs of Python. We're comfortable making all sorts of data types, writing functions, and creating classes. But now we need to look at how our Python code should be formatted so it matches the standard.
We'll also look at how to get our code to give us help() and how we can use logging and pdb to help us keep track of  what's going on inside the code.","['Cleaner Code', 'Buggy Logs']"
Dates and Times in Python,120,Dates and times are something every programmer eventually has to deal with. Python's implementation is fairly simple and simplifies these often tricky subjects.,"['Dates and Times', ""Let's Build a Timed Quiz App"", 'Where on Earth do Timezones Make Sense?']"
